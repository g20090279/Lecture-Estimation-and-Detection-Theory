# Introduction of Linear Bayesian Estimators

Why exploit the linear model of Bayesian estimators from the optimal Bayesian estimators?

The optimal Bayesian estimators have some disadvantages although they gives the optimal solution in estimation

- they are difficult to determine in closed form,
- they are too computationally intensive (involve multidimensional integration for MMSE estimator and multidimensional maximization for the MAP estimator),
- therefore, they are not in general easily found (can be easily found under the jointly Gaussian assumption).

What we can do to leverage the computation complexity of the optimal Bayesian estimators is to constrain the solution space, where the relation between the estimator and the observation is **linear**. With this constrain, an explicit form the the estimator may be determined which depends only on the **first two moments** of the PDF.
